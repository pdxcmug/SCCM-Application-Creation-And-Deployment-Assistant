# SCCM-Application-Creation-And-Deployment-Assistant
The Application Creation Assistant script is meant to streamline and standardize the creation of applications. After the application is created, the requirements and detection method have to be added manually from the console. The Application Deployment script is meant to be a companion to the Application Creation Assistant, although it can be run standalone as well. After the aforementioned script is ran, this script will aid in the deployment of the application to user collections.
